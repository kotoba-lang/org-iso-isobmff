(ns isobmff.avc-stsd-test
  "Tests for `isobmff.mux/avcc`/`avc-stsd`/`avc-track` — the video counterpart of
   `aac-stsd`, and the last thing between `kotoba-lang/org-iso-h264`'s encoder and
   an MP4 that carries its output (`com-junkawasaki/root` ADR-2800002800).

   Two independent references, same as the audio side:

   1. **Real ffmpeg's own boxes.** `av_sample.mp4` contains an `avc1`/`avcC` that
      ffmpeg wrote. `avcc-is-byte-identical-to-ffmpegs` feeds ffmpeg's OWN
      parameter sets back through this writer and requires the same bytes out —
      not merely the same fields. That is achievable here (unlike the AAC case,
      where ffmpeg appends an optional SBR sync extension) and is therefore the
      strongest available statement about the record's layout.
   2. **A parser written separately from the writer**, which also has to read
      ffmpeg's bytes, so a writer/reader pair agreeing on a wrong layout is
      caught.

   ## The part that is easy to get silently wrong

   Not the boxes — the SAMPLES. MP4 carries length-prefixed NAL units, not the
   Annex B start codes an encoder emits, and the parameter sets belong to `avcC`
   rather than to the samples. A muxer that copied Annex B into `mdat` produces a
   file that parses, reports the right codec and resolution, and decodes to
   nothing. `annexb->sample` is tested on its own for exactly that reason.

   ## `avc_video.mp4`

   Built by the pipeline this box exists to enable — `org-iso-h264`'s encoder ->
   `avc-track` -> `mux` — and verified with real ffmpeg: `ffprobe` reports
   `Video: h264 (Baseline) (avc1 / 0x31637661), yuv420p, 128x96, 30 fps`, and
   `ffmpeg -i avc_video.mp4 -f rawvideo` returns YUV **byte-identical** to
   decoding the same access units as a raw Annex B stream, so the container
   contributes no error. Committed as the bytes ffmpeg accepted; regenerating it
   needs org-iso-h264's ENCODER, which this repo does not depend on (it depends
   on the SPS parser only), so it is a fixture rather than a test step.

   ffmpeg additionally writes `pasp` and `btrt` boxes inside its sample entry.
   Both are optional and this writer omits them; the test asserts ffmpeg has them
   so that difference stays a known one."
